The bubble chart below shows the relationships between literacy and homicide rates by country income groups in 2012. 

In general, most countries are clustered around the lower part of the homicides but scattered throughout literacy rate. High income (both OECD and nonOECO) countries are in the uppermost left corner, indicating high literacy rate and low homicides. They have the least dispersion on both axes. 

On the other hand, lower middle income and upper middle income countries have the most dispersion throughout the x-axis, the homicides. Low income countries have most dispersion throughout the y-axis, but most are at the lower end of the homicides.
